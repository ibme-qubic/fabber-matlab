Fabber MATLAB interface
=======================

This module contains a thin wrapper between Matlab and the Fabber_ Bayesian model fitting tool. 
It works by calling the command line programs and writing out data sets as temporary Nifti files.

The Matlab toolbox `Tools for Nifti and Analyze`_ is required for the wrapper to work.

If you already have Fabber installed as part of FSL_ 6.0.1+ this interface should work 
without any further configuration. If you don't have FSL, a packages is available with
a pre-built set of Fabber binaries which contain a selection of model libraries. This package 
can be obtained from:

https://github.com/ibme-qubic/fabber_core/releases

In this case you should set the ``FABBERDIR`` environment variable to point to the location where you
downloaded the package.

Example usage
-------------

Simple script to fit a polynomial model to random data - this is included in the
``fabber_example.m`` script::

    % Create random 4D dataset and mask
    rundata = struct();
    rundata.data = rand(10, 10, 10, 5);
    rundata.mask = logical(ones(10, 10, 10));

    % Infer using polynomial model
    rundata.model='poly';
    rundata.degree=2;
    rundata.method='vb';
    rundata.noise='white';
    rundata.save_mean=true;
    rundata.save_model_fit=true;

    output = fabber(rundata);

``output`` is a structure with a named element for each Fabber output, for example
``output.mean_c0`` is the parameter map for the ``c0`` parameter. ``output.modelfit`` 
contains the 4D model prediction.

Option specification
--------------------

Many Fabber options contain ``-`` characters (e.g. ``save-mean``), which cannot be used as 
field names in a Matlab structure. This poses a problem, because this is what we use
to pass the ``rundata`` options in the above example. 

The solution is to substitute underscore characters ``_`` instead, as we have done 
for the ``save-mean`` parameter which is specified as ``rundata.save_mean``. The Matlab interface
will convert the underscores back into ``-`` before passing them to Fabber.

Only a couple of core Fabber options contain a ``_`` normally and these are handled specially.
Models should never use an underscore in their options.

Additional voxel data
---------------------

Additional data required for some models can be specified in the rundata in the expected
way, for example::

    aif = load_untouch_nii('aif.nii.gz')
    rundata.suppdata = aif.img

Issues/Limitations/ToDo
-----------------------

 - Error handling is largely non-existant at present
 
 - There is currently no provision for matrix-data to be passed directly - for example the dataspec in CEST. As currently, this must be written to a file and the filename passed as the appropriate option.
